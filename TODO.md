# TODO: Add Sliding Sheet for Profile Options with Professional Animations

## Steps to Complete

- [ ] Update nav.component.html: Add a profile button and sliding sheet div with professional animations (e.g., smooth slide-in/out, fade effects, easing).
- [ ] Update nav.component.ts: Add toggleSheet() method, editProfile() method to open profile dialog, logout() method, and import necessary services (MatDialog, AppKeycloakService).
- [ ] Test the implementation: Verify sheet toggles with animations, profile edit opens dialog, logout works.
